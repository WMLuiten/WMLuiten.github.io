I"8<p>Hi! I am Willemijn, a 27 year old woman from Amsterdam, living together with her cat: Mila. After completing my Bachelor’s degree in Applied Physics and my Master’s in Science, Education and Communication at the University of Twente, I moved to Amsterdam to teach Physics. While I enjoyed teaching, I missed technology, which is why I switched career paths and became a Data Scientist.</p>

<p>In my spare time I visit cinemas, go to the gym, crochet, knit or get together with friends. I plan on filling this blog with movie reviews and personal projects.</p>
