I"Ñ<p>Get ready for some wonderful absurdism! This movie is about Evelyn, owner of a laundromat and her boring, but stressful life. The IRS audit is upcoming and Evelyn struggles to get everything together. Deidre the IRS lady, a personification of bureaucracy, does not plan on letting this slide. The chaos begins inside the IRS building, where Evelyn meets an alternative version of her husband Waymond, in the janitor closet. Alternate Waymond thinks this Evelyn is the one to save the universe.</p>

<p>Hopping from one universe to another, with a different skillset in each of them, we get to know Evelyn and her family. The movie does not hold back in its absurdity and will give you enough to laugh about. It touches some sensitive subjects as well, mostly in a light hearted manner.</p>

<p>While I really enjoyed the movie, I think it could have been condensed into two hours or less, instead of the almost 140 mins it is right now. Otherwise, definitely recommend.</p>
