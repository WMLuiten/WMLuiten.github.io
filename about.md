Hi! I am Willemijn, a 27 year old woman from Amsterdam, living together with her cat: Mila. After completing my Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics and my Master's in Science, Education and Communication at the University of Twente, I moved to Amsterdam to teach Physics. While I enjoyed teaching, I missed technology, which is why I switched career paths and became a Data Scientist.

In my spare time I visit cinemas, go to the gym, crochet, knit or get together with friends. While this blog is fairly empty right now, I plan to fill it with movie reviews and personal projects.
